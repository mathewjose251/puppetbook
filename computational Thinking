computational thinking
 Computational thinking gives us the basis to organise our thought process,
and a language to communicate such organisation to others including a computer.
The organising part has relation to the study of algorithms, the language part to
the design of programming languages and systems and the last communication

part to the activity of coding in a given programming language. Thus compu-
tational thinking provides the foundation for learning how to translate any real

world problem into a computer program or system through the use of algorithms,
languages and coding.

case for OS version

case $facts['os']['release']['major'] {
        '5':         { } # This module does not manage RHEL5 repos

        '6','7','8': { include mod::repos }

        default:     { fail("Unknown release: ${facts['os']['release']['major']}") }
    }
Conditional statements in the Puppet DSL (such as if, unless, case, and the selector operator) allow you to assign a variable once, but assign it differently based on a specific condition. Using the previous example of Puppet’s configuration directory, let’s see how that would be assigned differently, based on the system’s kernel fact:
